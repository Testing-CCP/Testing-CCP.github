GitHub Enterprise Server versions are decoupled from REST API versions. You can upgrade your GitHub Enterprise Server version but keep the same REST API version, as long as the API version is included in the GitHub Enterprise Server version. Similarly, you can upgrade your REST API version without updating your GitHub Enterprise Server version, as long as the new REST API version you  is available for your GitHub Enterprise Server version.
